# Project Overview

## What We’re Building

This is a modular Web3 DApp playground for learning and experimenting with blockchain technologies. The project will include:

- Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- NFT minting (ERC-721)
- NFT marketplace (list, buy, sell)
- Token faucet (ERC-20)
- Airdrop functionality
- Modular frontend with Next.js (React) and Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain:** Solidity, Hardhat or Foundry, Ethers.js, MetaMask, OpenZeppelin, IPFS/Pinata (optional)
- **Professional Tools:**
  - ESLint & Prettier (code quality & formatting)
  - Husky & Commitlint (commit message standards)
  - SonarCloud (code analytics)
  - GitHub (version control)
  - VS Code (IDE)
  - Figma (UI/UX design, to be added)
- **Other:**
  - EditorConfig (consistent coding styles)
  - Jest/React Testing Library (testing, optional)
  - CI/CD (GitHub Actions, optional)

## Professional Environment

- Automated code linting and formatting
- Commit message enforcement
- Code analytics and review (SonarCloud, CodeRabbit)
- Version control with GitHub
- Ready for team collaboration and open source

- Practice using conventional commit formats (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, etc.)
- Use feature branches for new functionality, bug fixes, and experiments
- Merge branches via pull requests for code review and collaboration

## Software & Tools To Use

- **VS Code:** Main code editor
- **Figma:** For UI/UX design and prototyping
- **GitHub:** Repository hosting and code reviews
- **SonarCloud:** Code quality analytics
- **CodeRabbit:** AI-powered code review (optional)

## Visualization & Code Reviews

- SonarCloud dashboard for code quality and maintainability
- GitHub pull requests for code review
- CodeRabbit for automated review comments

## Next Steps

- Build initial pages/components
- Integrate wallet connection
- Add blockchain features step by step
- Design UI in Figma

- Practice making commits with all conventional formats
- Use different branches for features, fixes, and experiments, then merge via pull requests
